Hi!
I'm Tanya. 

I am currently studying Games Programming at the Breda University of applied science. 
I've been looking into more Graphics Programming related topics, even wrote some blog posts about them. In most group projects I have been able to shine by taking on a broad range of tasks, like dealing with more design heavy gameplay programming, handling Dev-Ops (including CI/CD pipelines), being more involved in QA processes, or even just setting up Itch.io or Steam pages.

Most of my coding experience is focused on C++. With some low-level insights coming from custom tech projects, as well as working within larger frameworks, like Unreal Engine.
I still dabble in other languages of course like C#, mostly in the context of Unity.

Currently looking for a programming internship.
